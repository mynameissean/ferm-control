V2 of the Fermentation Chamber

Folder structure:
	Arduino contains the core code that runs Sean's Arduino fermentation chamber
	
The starting point of this code base is within the .ino file.  From there, the code branches out to specific elements and modules.  The most recent feature, directed control, is still a work in progress.  While the structure of the code is in place, elements like Communicator.cpp and others which are directly responsible for interpreting commands are code skeletons at best.
